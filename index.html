              <h3 class="mb-0">On your end</h3>
                <br><p>
                  On your end, it's simple! Just fill out this <a href="https://letterlift.com/" target="_blank">interest form</a>
                  or send us an <a href="mailto:letterlift@proton.me" target="_blank">email</a>.
                  We'll coordinate with you to get details on what you're applying for and what you're seeking review on.
                  Then wait for us to do our magic (typically 1-3 business days), and we'll send you a revised copy of your document with comments and suggestions.
                <br /><br />
                  We sometimes get asked to do a follow up review, especially for documents that have more extensive revisions.
                  If this applies to you, please don't hesitate to ask. We're in this to see you succeed.
                </p><br />

              <h3 class="mb-0">Behind the scenes</h3>
                <br><p>
                  It takes a little bit more work on our end, but we spend the time because we care about quality.
                  Once we have details regarding your application, documents, and timeline, our process usually goes like this.
                <br /><br />
                  We don't dive into your documents right away. We first get information about what you're applying to.
                  This often involves reading through the job description or graduate program and learning about the institution or
                  technical requirements. Only then do we start reviewing your materials. We typically take at least two passes
                  through a document, one for structure and copyedits, and one for a deeper dive into the content.
                <br /><br />
                  <blockquote>
                  <b>Pro tip:</b> When going through your own materials, put on your reviewer hat. Take the time to view
                  it with fresh eyes. Imagine you were the hiring manager or admissions officer. <i>What would make this candidate
                  great for the role or program? What areas could the candidate improve upon?</i> Oftentimes you don't have the
                  luxury, time, or resources to strengthen those weaker areas. But doing this review can help you realize
                  adjacent areas of your experience that can help compensate. For example, you might not have formal project
                  management experience, but you can describe in your cover letter how you've taken on project management duties
                  in a previous role or further education or training you're pursuing in this area.
                  </blockquote>
                <br /><br />
                  We take a comprehensive, detail-oriented approach to our review.
                  Our feedback ranges from copyedits on missing punctuation, guidance on content hierarchy and layout,
                  and suggestions for how to directly tailor your material to the application.
                  Remember, it's <i>your</i> document. You have the final say. Always feel free to ignore any feedback that you don't agree with.
                </p>

          <br /><p><i>
            PhD in Chemistry, hired as Program Writer at a FAANG company
          </i><br><br>
            Working with Victoria was great. I felt totally unprepared for the job search after graduate school, but Victoria was really nonjudgmental and kind.
            I loved having a 1:1 connection with someone who understood where I was coming from and that was reflected in the way she provided feedback and suggestions.
            She really helped emphasize parts of my PhD into real hirable skills,
            and I recommend LetterLift for anyone looking to take their writing to the next level!

          <h3 class="mb-0">Justin</h3>
          <br /><p><i>
            PhD in Physics, hired as Data Scientist at a healthcare technology company
          </i><br><br>
            Victoria changed my career! I was struggling to transition from the public to the private sector.
            She helped me craft both my resume and cover letter for industry data science positions.
            For the resume, she had both an eye for content as well as organization and structure.
            She was able to distill the salient parts of my past experience and helped make the resume visually appealing instead of a cluttered mess.
            Similarly for my cover letter, she was able to help me tell my own story and made my opening and conclusion significantly more compelling and impactful.
            Through the whole process Victoria helped me understand how to better talk about my career journey
            and how to emphasize the key parts hiring managers care about. I give her a lot of credit for helping me land a job in industry!

          <h3 class="mb-0">Alex</h3>
          <br /><p><i>
            Software Engineer at Illumina, accepted to M.S. programs in bioinformatics
          </i><br><br>
            When I was writing my personal statement to apply to graduate schools for an MS in bioinformatics, I was <b>overwhelmed by the lack of structure</b> provided by the institutions I was applying to. I had a sense of the story I wanted to tell but was <b>struggling to synthesize the ideas in a way that was aligned with what the admissions officers were seeking</b>.<br/><br/>
            Getting feedback on something deeply personal is uncomfortable and I don’t take criticism well. When we were working on my personal statement, I really got the sense that we were <b>working as a team</b>. She was always incredibly careful to make sure she understood what I was trying to communicate before she gave feedback which made the process strangely pleasant. She also has this otherworldly ability to <b>distill what the other side of the table is looking for</b> and restructure the document accordingly, which helped me enormously to alter the tone and craft bespoke personal statements for each institution.<br/><br/>
            Working with Victoria was a game changer. In a little over an hour we were able to revise my personal statement in a way that I was able to tell my story but in a vastly more concise, targeted, and personalized manner.<b> In the end I was accepted into Master’s programs for Johns Hopkins, Northeastern, and NYU.</b>
