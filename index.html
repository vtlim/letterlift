          <p>
            I'm passionate about helping others develop in their scientific and career journeys.
            Sometimes that comes through sharing my own journey, failures and all.
            Other times that manifests by sharing tips, tricks, and advice in presentations and blog posts.
            Finally, through LetterLift, I provide one-on-one resume review for those applying for jobs, grad schools, or fellowship programs.

              <h3 class="mb-0">On your end</h3>
                <p>
                  On your end, it's simple! Just fill out this <a href="https://letterlift.com/" target="_blank">interest form</a>
                  or send us an <a href="mailto:letterlift@proton.me" target="_blank">email</a>.
                  We'll coordinate with you to get details on what you're applying for and what you're seeking review on.
                  Then wait for us to do our magic (typically 1-3 business days), and we'll send you a revised copy of your document with comments and suggestions.
                </p><br />
                <p>
                  We sometimes get asked to do a follow up review, especially for documents that have more extensive revisions.
                  If this applies to you, please don't hesitate to ask. We're in this to see you succeed.
                </p><br />

              <h3 class="mb-0">On our end</h3>
                <p>
                  It takes a little bit more work on our end, but we spend the time because we care about quality.
                  Once we have details regarding your application, documents, and timeline, our process usually goes like this.
                </p><br />
                <p>
                  We don't dive into your documents right away. We first get information about what you're applying to.
                  This often involves reading through the job description or graduate program and learning about the institution or
                  technical requirements. Only then do we start reviewing your materials. We typically take at least two passes
                  through a document, one for structure and copyedits, and one for a deeper dive into the content.
                </p><br />
                <p>
                  <b>Pro tip:</b> When going through your own materials, put on your reviewer hat. Take the time to view
                  it with fresh eyes. Imagine you were the hiring manager or admissions officer. <i>What would make this candidate
                  great for the role or program? What areas could the candidate improve upon?</i> Oftentimes you don't have the
                  luxury, time, or resources to strengthen those weaker areas. But even doing this review can help you realize
                  other areas of your experience that can help compensate. For example, you might not have formal project
                  management experience, but you can describe in your cover letter how you've taken on project management duties
                  in a previous role or further education or training you're pursuing in this area.
                </p><br />
                <p>
                  We take a comprehensive, detail-oriented approach to our review.
                  Our feedback ranges from copyedits on missing punctuation, guidance on content hierarchy and layout,
                  and suggestions for how to directly tailor your material to the application.
                  Remember, it's <i>your</i> document. You have the final say. Feel free to ignore any feedback that you don't agree with.
                </p><br />

                Through LetterLift, I provide editing services for those applying to jobs, grad school, or fellowship programs,
                with a focus on undergraduate and graduate students in the sciences.
                A typical consultation includes copyediting, structural feedback, and suggestions for material improvements
                on resumes, cover letters, or personal statements.
                I've worked with PhD students applying for their first job out of graduate school,
                students applying for fellowships (e.g., NSF GRFP, AAAS STPF),
                full-time professionals applying for their next role,
                and those applying for admission to graduate programs.

                I served as a Communications Consultant for the Graduate Resource Center at UC Irvine in 2017-2019.
                Graduate students and postdoctoral scholars booked appointments with me to practice presentations
                presentations and solicit individualized feedback and advice.
                I worked with 25 grad students and postdocs preparing for job interviews, conference talks,
                doctoral candidacy exams, and TA lectures. In addition, I coached two international graduate students
                to pass English proficiency exams.

          <div class="subheading mb-3">PhD in Chemistry, hired as Program Writer at a FAANG company</div>
          <p>
            Working with Victoria was great. I felt totally unprepared for the job search after graduate school, but Victoria was really nonjudgmental and kind.
            I loved having a 1:1 connection with someone who understood where I was coming from and that was reflected in the way she provided feedback and suggestions.
            She really helped emphasize parts of my PhD into real hirable skills,
            and I recommend LetterLift for anyone looking to take their writing to the next level!
          </p>

          <h4 class="mb-0">Justin</h4>
          <div class="subheading mb-3">PhD in Physics, hired as Data Scientist at a healthcare technology company</div>
          <p>
            Victoria changed my career! I was struggling to transition from the public to the private sector.
            She helped me craft both my resume and cover letter for industry data science positions.
            For the resume, she had both an eye for content as well as organization and structure.
            She was able to distill the salient parts of my past experience and helped make the resume visually appealing instead of a cluttered mess.
            Similarly for my cover letter, she was able to help me tell my own story and made my opening and conclusion significantly more compelling and impactful.
            Through the whole process Victoria helped me understand how to better talk about my career journey
            and how to emphasize the key parts hiring managers care about. I give her a lot of credit for helping me land a job in industry!

          <h4 class="mb-0">Alex</h4>
          <div class="subheading mb-3">Software Engineer at Illumina, accepted to M.S. programs in bioinformatics</div>
          <p>
            When I was writing my personal statement to apply to graduate schools for an MS in bioinformatics, I was <b>overwhelmed by the lack of structure</b> provided by the institutions I was applying to. I had a sense of the story I wanted to tell but was <b>struggling to synthesize the ideas in a way that was aligned with what the admissions officers were seeking</b>.<br/>
            Getting feedback on something deeply personal is uncomfortable and I don’t take criticism well. When we were working on my personal statement, I really got the sense that we were <b>working as a team</b>. She was always incredibly careful to make sure she understood what I was trying to communicate before she gave feedback which made the process strangely pleasant. She also has this otherworldly ability to <b>distill what the other side of the table is looking for</b> and restructure the document accordingly, which helped me enormously to alter the tone and craft bespoke personal statements for each institution.<br/>
            Working with Victoria was a game changer. In a little over an hour we were able to revise my personal statement in a way that I was able to tell my story but in a vastly more concise, targeted, and personalized manner.<b> In the end I was accepted into Master’s programs for Johns Hopkins, Northeastern, and NYU.</b>
