# LetterLift website

vtlim.github.io/letterlift

Aliased using CNAME record in GitHub to letterlift.com

My custom domain is registered on NameCheap, and I added the A records there to point to the IP addresses for GitHub Pages.

Originally built as a Gatsby site (December 2022).
Relaunched using Bootstrap in June 2024.
